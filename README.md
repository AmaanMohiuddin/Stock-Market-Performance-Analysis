# Stock-Market-Performance-Analysis

Overview
This project is a Python-based notebook designed for Stock and Market Performance Analytics. It provides tools and methodologies for performing statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization using Python's powerful libraries.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares datasets for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Generates summary statistics, correlation matrices, and hypothesis testing.
Predictive Modeling:
Implements machine learning models for classification and regression tasks.
Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
Visualization:
Creates charts and graphs for exploratory data analysis.
Visualizes model performance with plots such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Interactive Analysis: Through Jupyter Notebook, users can modify and rerun code blocks for exploratory and dynamic analysis.
